Unemployment Analysis with Python is a data analysis project that examines unemployment trends using real-world data. The project focuses on understanding changes in unemployment rates, especially the impact of Covid-19, through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. 

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which represents the percentage of people who are unemployed in the total labor force. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, unemployment rates increased significantly across many regions. This project analyzes unemployment data to identify trends, patterns, and insights using Python.

## Objectives that the project fulfills: 
- Analyze unemployment rate data
- Understand the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment
- Visualize trends over time
- Perform basic statistical analysis

## Dataset used in the project is as follows: 
- The dataset contains unemployment rate statistics
- Data includes time-based unemployment records
- Source: Publicly available unemployment datasets

## Tools & Technologies ussed: 
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## What my project does: 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
